# ChallengeWK2

Be competent in the use of docker

What was the challenge? - The challenge was to build images using Docker of a database and a flask app, run them in Docker containers, have them communicate using a network and include a password for security.
How I expected the challenge to go. - I was confident in my understanding of Docker and how to use it after covering the modules. As I had access to videos of the demo's I was confident the task was acheiveable. I also had the piece of mind that Ben, our trainer would be on hand to lend assistance if required.

What went well? - The demo's were essential in getting a handle on using Docker, I was able to quickly reference any gaps in knowledge as well as verify the steps required at each stage.

What didn't go as planned? Unfortunately I experienced issues with my VM, it would had connectivity issues and would freeze when running the Docker build commands. I was forced to wipe the storage clean a few times as well has reset the VM in order to complete the challenge. I also hadn't planned on 2 scheduled meetings which took longer than expected, this took up quite alot my time, about 3 hours unexpectedly particularly very close to the 3pm deadline. In the end I was assisted by Holly and Ben to complete the task.

Possible improvements for future challenges. In future I would test the VM first thing in the morning, on this occasion I watched the demo's in the morning to write down the correct syntax for the tasks. By the time I was ready to work in the VM, the scheduled meetings were looming and this meant reduced time on the challenge.
